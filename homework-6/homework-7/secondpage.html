    <p style="color: lightblue;">Hello, my name is Lexi and I do alot of different kinds of art but my favorite is protography and digital art right now. I'm studying art and so I really enjoy it. Here are some images below that I created/took a picture of! I'm from Kalispell and live here in Missoula now. This is the short story of me :)</p>
