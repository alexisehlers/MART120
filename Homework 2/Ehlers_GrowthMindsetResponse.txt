Growth Mindset Response
01 September 2020
     In taking the mindset quiz, my results were 42 pts—which surprised me. I didn’t expect to score so low, though I suspected I was slightly prejudiced against the idea of a growth mindset. This is since I really struggle with my intellect in certain areas, like math and science, and it leads me to believe that I am just not so smart in that way. I know this not to be 100% true though, because in other areas like art and music, I can see where people struggle and I know that it is a skill just like anything and takes practice. When I watched the short talk on Growth Mindset and heard about the kids who were exposed to that type of learning succeeding more than the other children, I was encouraged. I believe that I need to be more encouraging in my internal dialogue to myself and instead of negative responses to hard things, I can learn to see them as an opportunity to grow. My perspective has changed a bit in this way, in that I need not always strive for perfection but rather to strive to do my best. Differentiating that line between my best and perfect is rather hard though.
     The effect that growth mindset principles have on my outlook going forward, might emerge in practical ways like being more patient with myself. If I am unable to do something I want to keep trying, and improve with each time. Another thing I’ll hold in my mind is that if I have a healthier outlook I will become smarter, and learn new things more effectively, and that yes it is possible to become smarter even in my decrepit areas. I really would like to start to give a more positive voice to different tasks and instead of tearing myself down feel encouraged.
