The Last Lecture: Response
01 September 2020
     When I first clicked on the assignment video, the thing that stood out to me was the caption “following your childhood dreams.” This is something that I’ve been thinking a lot about recently, and I was interested in what Randy Pausch had to say. What really stuck with me is how sometimes he had to compromise on his ideals of dreams as a child and what resulted was sometimes even better than what he imagined. Another thing was how much he was able to learn, and grow from, those dreams that he wasn’t able to achieve. They were stumbling blocks that directed him towards something greater. I also really loved how he emphasized how he needed to humble himself in front of people, show his sincerity, and just work hard in order to succeed. Often the way he discovered this was through the well-meaning advice of mentors. 
     I learned in watching the talk, that I need to open up my mindset more and allow myself to be more actively constructively criticized by others. Mentors and challenging peers are crucial in someone’s development and I think that I am lacking in that, and need to surround myself with more of that type of people. Another flaw in myself that was illuminated to me was my need to strive for perfection that often overwhelms me and causes me to give up. With a growth mindset, I think I can develop a healthier way to approach challenges and find a way around those brick walls that are blocking me from achieving my dreams. Overall I was inspired and I think it helped me in finding motivation for this week.
